## How to Use

## Core Files

- `lrfhss_core.py`: core classes and logic used to build simulation scenarios.
- `settings.py`: configuration file for simulation parameters.
- `run.py`: example simulation that sets up a network and outputs performance metrics.

---

## Extensions

- `traffic.py`: defines various traffic generators for `Node` objects.
- `acrda.py`: alternative `Base` class implementing ACRDA receiver/decoder.
